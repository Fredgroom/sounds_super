        <strong>Sounds Super</strong> specialise in producing entertainment
        podcasts and vertical video to support and amplify.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that emotion is the most powerful way to connect with people.
        That's why <strong>we always start with a feeling</strong> when we
        create our content. We want our listeners to feel something when they
        listen to our work - whether it's laughter, sadness, excitement, or
        anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that both podcast audio and socal video are powerful and
        personal mediums that speak directly to people. And they work
        phenomenally well together - like salt on popcorn or Ant & Dec.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, whether someone’s listening to the latest episode of ‘What the
        Fork?’ with Tom Kerridge and Chris Stark while walking their dog, or
        taking a backstage tour of Strictly with Joe Sugg on Tik-Tok before bed…
        <strong>our audience is always part of the story.</strong>
